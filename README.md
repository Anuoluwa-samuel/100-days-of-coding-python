I sought out to begin a personal challenge that I named "91daysofslowlybecoming" and part of my goal was to become a Python developer which as of day 0, I am not. 

💯 100 Days of Code

Welcome to my journey through the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023** by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.appbrewery.co/). This repository serves as my personal log, code archive, and accountability tool as I go from Python beginner to proficient developer.
